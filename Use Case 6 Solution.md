# The Oderinde Brothers


## Creating and Managing a SharePoint Intranet Site
The below steps are involved in creating, configuring, and managing a SharePoint Intranet Site for ‘The Oderinde Brothers’.


## 1. Creating a SharePoint Communication Site
A SharePoint Communication Site is designed to broadcast information broadly across an organization. It serves as a central hub where employees can access news, resources, and updates. Unlike Team Sites, Communication Sites are focused on informing rather than collaborating, making them ideal for internal portals that highlight company-wide announcements, policies, and essential documents.

## Steps to creating a SharePoint Communication Site for *The Oderinde Brothers*:
- Go to https://www.office.com > Click on ‘Apps’ > All apps
- Launch the SharePoint app
- Click “Create Site” > Choose “Communication Site”
- Select a template (Organization home) > Use template
- Give your site a name (e.g., The Oderinde Hub), and provide a description.
- Click Next
- Set language and other options > Create site
   

## 2. Customize the Homepage
The homepage of a SharePoint Communication Site can be tailored to reflect your organization’s brand and priorities. By using web parts such as News, Hero, Quick Links, and Events, you can create an engaging and informative landing page. This helps employees stay updated with the latest announcements, navigate important resources quickly, and build a unified digital workplace experience.

## Steps to customizing the Homepage of the communication site for *The Oderinde Brothers*:
- Go to https://techtired.sharepoint.com/sites/TheOderindeHub?market=en-US
- Click on the plus sign + (create) among the list of items on the left-hand pane > News Post
- Click on ‘The Oderinde Hub’ on the popped-out pane
- Click on ‘Basic text’ as your news template > create post
- Click on ‘Add a title’ to give the news post a title and description
- Click ‘Add event’ to spice up the customization of the page
- Add the details of the event
- You can choose to further customize the homepage by adding pages etc.
  

## 3. Configure User Permissions 
SharePoint enables you to control access and maintain security through permission settings. You can create custom SharePoint groups for each department—such as Human Resources, IT, Finance, Legal, and Engineering—and assign appropriate permission levels (e.g., Read, Contribute, Edit). This ensures that only authorized personnel can view or edit specific content, maintaining both security and content relevance.

## Steps in Configuring User Permissions for *The Oderinde Brothers*:
- Go to https://techtired.sharepoint.com/sites/TheOderindeHub
- Click on settings (the gear symbol at the upper right) > site permissions > Advanced Permissions settings
- Click ‘Create Group’ > Fill in the name, description, owner, and settings of the group > create (You can repeat this process in creating many groups, which serves as departments)
  

## 4. Create Department-Specific Pages or Document Libraries
Department-specific pages or document libraries allow each unit within the organization to manage and share content relevant to their roles. For example, HR can maintain policy documents, IT can post user guides, and Finance can store budget templates. These areas can be permission-trimmed so only the intended department sees or interacts with their respective content, improving organization and data privacy.

## Steps in creating Department-Specific Pages or Document Libraries for *The Oderinde Brothers*:
- Go to https://techtired.sharepoint.com/sites/TheOderindeHub
- Click on settings (the gear symbol at the upper right) > site contents
- Click New > Document library
- Give the name and description of the library > create (Use this process to create as many libraries as you want)
- Click on the three dots (…) on the home page to view all libraries created
  

Project Summary
To streamline communication and document accessibility across departments, we created a SharePoint Communication Site named The Oderinde Hub. The portal serves as a central intranet for sharing company news, accessing policy documents, and linking department resources.
We implemented:
•	Custom web parts such as News, Quick Links, and Group Calendars
•	Document libraries with access control tailored to Human Resources, IT, Finance, Legal, and Engineering

The result is a professional, secure, and dynamic internal platform that empowers employees to stay informed, collaborate efficiently, and access critical resources with ease.
