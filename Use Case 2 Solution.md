PROJECT SUMMARY: Implementing email encryption for sensitive communication at M & V Chambers significantly enhanced data confidentiality and compliance with organizational policies. By configuring mail flow rules for automatic encryption, outgoing emails containing sensitive information are now safeguarded. Verifying encryption for external recipients ensured that confidential messages could be securely accessed even by those outside the Microsoft 365 environment. Additionally, providing end users with a manual encryption guide empowered them to independently secure their communications when necessary. These combined measures established a robust and user-friendly encryption framework, fortifying the firm's sensitive email communications against unauthorized access and ensuring reliable data protection.
